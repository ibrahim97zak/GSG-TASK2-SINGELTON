# User Session Manager
## auther : ibrahim zakarneh

## Overview
The User Session Manager is a TypeScript application demonstrating the Singleton pattern. It manages a user session, ensuring only one instance exists throughout the application's lifecycle for consistency and control.
## Features
### *Set User Session: Initialize user details.
###  *Get User Session: Retrieve user details.
###  *Clear User Session: Clear the session.

## Why Use Singleton?
Using the Singleton pattern in the User Session Manager ensures that only one instance of the session exists throughout the application. This provides a consistent and centralized view of the session data, preventing any conflicts or inconsistencies.

It also simplifies management by having a single point of control, making it easier to debug and maintain. Plus, it conserves resources and improves performance by avoiding the creation of multiple instances.
